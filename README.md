###### Venice

I like the food especially pasta and its also known as city of canals. That's what i like about the city.
It's a city build on water also know as **The floating city** and the city rests on **118 islands** separated by 150 canals.

# Dynamic Programming,Linear Algebra and Numerical Methods

> Dynamic Programming -  A DP is an algorithmic technique which is usually based on a recurrent formula and one (or some) starting states. A sub-solution of the problem is constructed from previously found ones. DP solutions have a polynomial complexity which assures a much faster running time than other techniques like backtracking, brute-force etc.

vector<long long> dp_before(n), dp_cur(n);

> Linear Algebra - Linear algebra, mathematical discipline that deals with vectors and matrices and, more generally, with vector spaces and linear transformations. Unlike other parts of mathematics that are frequently invigorated by new ideas and unsolved problems, linear algebra is very well understood. Its value lies in its many applications, from mathematical physics to modern algebra and coding theory.

> Numerical Methods - In numerical analysis, a numerical method is a mathematical tool designed to solve numerical problems. The implementation of a numerical method with an appropriate convergence check in a programming language is called a numerical algorithm.
